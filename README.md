# Weather-Forecast-using-KNN

#Abstract
focus on the K nearest neighbor technology, and use it to predict weather conditions by applying it to a dataset.

#Evaluation
Algorithm evaluation is done through accuracy and performance Accuracy: In all experiments, it was greater than 0.90, which is a very good result Performance: The algorithm is relatively fast in performing predictions
